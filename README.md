this is my week 6 of learning springboot in this week we wil learn about spring ssecurity advanced.
Spring Boot Learning - Week 6
Overview
Week 6 focused on advanced security features in Spring Boot, including JWT refresh and access tokens, Google OAuth 2.0 login, session management, and various levels of authorization. This weekâ€™s learning has been pivotal in enhancing user experience and securing applications effectively.

Topics Covered
1. JWT Refresh and Access Tokens
JWT Access Tokens: Implemented JWT access tokens for stateless authentication, ensuring secure and efficient user session management.
JWT Refresh Tokens: Learned how to use JWT refresh tokens to provide a seamless user experience by allowing token renewal without requiring the user to re-authenticate frequently.
2. Google OAuth 2.0 Login
OAuth 2.0 Integration: Integrated Google OAuth 2.0 for authentication, enabling users to log in using their Google accounts.
Customizing OAuth 2.0 Flow: Customized the OAuth 2.0 login process to fit the specific needs of the application, including handling user details and storing them securely.
3. Session Management
Session Management Techniques: Explored various session management strategies in Spring Security, including stateless and stateful sessions.
Session Invalidation: Implemented session invalidation logic to ensure that user sessions are managed securely and effectively.
4. Role-Based Authorization
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Set up role-based authorization, ensuring that users can access resources and perform actions based on their roles (e.g., Admin, User).
Granular Authorization: Implemented fine-grained authorization to control access at a more detailed level, beyond simple role checks.
5. Spring Security Method Annotations
Method-Level Security: Applied Spring Security annotations like @PreAuthorize, @Secured, and @RolesAllowed to enforce security constraints at the method level.
Granular Control: Leveraged these annotations to provide granular control over who can execute specific methods or access particular business logic.
